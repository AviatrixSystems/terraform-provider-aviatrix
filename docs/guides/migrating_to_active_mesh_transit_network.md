# Aviatrix Transit Network Migration Guide

## USAGE
For customers who are currently already using Terraform to manage their infrastructure including Classic Aviatrix Encrypted Transit Network prior to Controller 6.6 and are looking to migrate their Classic Aviatrix Encrypted Transit Network to Aviatrix ActiveMesh Transit Network and upgrade their Controller to 6.6+, please follow along for guidance on the migration process to ensure a smooth transition.

## Migration Steps

If your Transit Network is built prior to Aviatrix software release 5.1, it’s very likely that the Transit Network is a non-ActiveMesh deployment where the IPSec tunnels between spoke gateways and transit gateways are in Active/Standby mode (i.e. only one IPSec tunnel is carrying the data traffic). Non-ActiveMesh features will be completely deprecated and removed in provider 2.21.0/controller 6.6. With non-ActiveMesh features, Aviatrix controller will not be able to upgrade to 6.6.

1. Detach Aviatrix Spoke Gateway from Transit Network
   - If Spoke was attached to Transit by **aviatrix_spoke_transit_attachment**, destroy **aviatrix_spoke_transit_attachment** resource
   - If Spoke was attached to Transit by setting ``transit_gw`` inside **aviatrix_spoke_gateway**, remove ``transit_gw`` and then perform a "terraform apply"
2. Detach Aviatrix Transit Gateway from all other peerings or connections (**aviatrix_transit_gateway_peering**, **aviatrix_site2cloud**)
3. Set “enable_active_mesh” to true in both **aviatrix_spoke_gateway** and **aviatrix_transit_gateway** to enable ActiveMesh for both Spoke and Transit Gateway
4. Reattach Aviatrix Spoke Gateway to Transit Network
   - If Spoke was attached to Transit by **aviatrix_spoke_transit_attachment**, recreate **aviatrix_spoke_transit_attachment** resource
   - If Spoke was attached to Transit by setting ``transit_gw`` inside **aviatrix_spoke_gateway**, reset ``transit_gw`` and then perform a "terraform apply"
