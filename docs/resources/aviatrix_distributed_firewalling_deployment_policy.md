  Creates and manages an Aviatrix Distributed-firewalling deployment policy

# aviatrix_distributed_firewalling_default_action_rule

The **aviatrix_distributed_firewalling_deployment_policy** resource handles the creation and management of Distributed-firewalling deployment policy. Available as of Provider 3.2.2+.

Default CSP providers: `["GCP", "AWS", "AWS-GOV", "AZURE-GOV", "AZURE", "AVX-TEST"]`
Once the Distributed Cloud Firewall (DCF) is enabled a default deployment policy is created with default CSP providers. We can override this by adding a deployment policy to limit the use of DCF for CSPs. The policy has creation has two fields:
-providers: This is a list of CSPs where DCF should be enabled.
-set_defaults: If this is set to true, the deployment policy will be enabled in default CSPs, if this is set to false, then it will enable DCF only in the CSPs mentioned in the providers list.

Once this policy is destroyed the providers will be reset back to the default set of providers.

Deployment policy list providers cannot be an empty list, if DCF is not needed in any CSPs then it is best to disable DCF entirely.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create an Aviatrix Distributed Firewalling Deployment Policy
resource "aviatrix_distributed_firewalling_deployment_policy" "test" {
  providers = ["AWS", "GCP"]
  set_defaults = false
}
