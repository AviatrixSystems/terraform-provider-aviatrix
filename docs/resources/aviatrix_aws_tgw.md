# aviatrix_aws_tgw

The **aviatrix_aws_tgw** resource allows the creation and management of Aviatrix-created AWS TGWs.

~> **NOTE:** If you are planning to attach VPCs to the **aviatrix_aws_tgw** resource and anticipate updating it often and/or using advanced options such as customized route advertisement, we highly recommend managing those VPCs outside this resource by setting `manage_vpc_attachment` to false and using the **aviatrix_aws_tgw_vpc_attachment** resource instead of the in-line `attached_vpc {}` block.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create an Aviatrix AWS TGW
resource "aviatrix_aws_tgw" "test_aws_tgw" {
  account_name                      = "devops"
  aws_side_as_number                = "64512"
  manage_vpc_attachment             = false
  manage_transit_gateway_attachment = false
  region                            = "us-east-1"
  tgw_name                          = "test-AWS-TGW"

  security_domains {
    connected_domains    = [
      "Default_Domain",
      "Shared_Service_Domain",
      "mysdn1"
    ]
    security_domain_name = "Aviatrix_Edge_Domain"
  }

  security_domains {
    connected_domains    = [
      "Aviatrix_Edge_Domain",
      "Shared_Service_Domain"
    ]    
    security_domain_name = "Default_Domain"
  }

  security_domains {
    connected_domains    = [
      "Aviatrix_Edge_Domain",
      "Default_Domain"
    ]
    security_domain_name = "Shared_Service_Domain"
  }

  security_domains {
    connected_domains    = [
      "Aviatrix_Edge_Domain"
    ]
    security_domain_name = "SDN1"
  }

  security_domains {
    security_domain_name = "mysdn2"
  }

  security_domains {
    security_domain_name = "firewall-domain"
    aviatrix_firewall    = true
  }
}
```
```hcl
# Create an Aviatrix AWSGov TGW
resource "aviatrix_aws_tgw" "test_aws_gov_tgw" {
  account_name                      = "devops"
  cloud_type                        = 256

  tgw_name                          = "test-AWSGov-TGW"

  security_domains {
    connected_domains    = [
      "Default_Domain",
      "Shared_Service_Domain",
      "mysdn1"
    ]
    security_domain_name = "Aviatrix_Edge_Domain"
  }

  security_domains {
    connected_domains    = [
      "Aviatrix_Edge_Domain",
      "Shared_Service_Domain"
    ]    
    security_domain_name = "Default_Domain"
  }

  security_domains {
    connected_domains    = [
      "Aviatrix_Edge_Domain",
      "Default_Domain"
    ]
    security_domain_name = "Shared_Service_Domain"
  }

  security_domains {
    connected_domains    = [
      "Aviatrix_Edge_Domain"
    ]
    security_domain_name = "SDN1"
  }

  security_domains {
    security_domain_name = "mysdn2"
  }

  security_domains {
    security_domain_name = "firewall-domain"
    aviatrix_firewall    = true
  }
}
```

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `tgw_id` - TGW ID. Available as of provider version R2.19+.

## Import

**aws_tgw** can be imported using the `tgw_name`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import aviatrix_aws_tgw.test tgw_name
```

-> **NOTE:** If `manage_security_domain` is set to "false", import action will also import the information of the security domains into the state file. Will need to do *terraform apply* to sync `manage_security_domain` to "false".

-> **NOTE:** If `manage_vpc_attachment` is set to "false", import action will also import the information of the VPCs attached to TGW into the state file. Will need to do *terraform apply* to sync `manage_vpc_attachment` to "false".

-> **NOTE:** If `manage_transit_gateway_attachment` is set to "false", import action will also import the information of the transit gateway attached to TGW into the state file. Will need to do *terraform apply* to sync `manage_transit_gateway_attachment` to "false".
