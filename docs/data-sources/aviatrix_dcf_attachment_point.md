# aviatrix_dcf_attachment_point

Use this data source to get the attachment point ID for a DCF attachment point when using it for attaching a policy group or ruleset to an attachment point.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "aviatrix_dcf_attachment_point" "example" {
    name = "my-attachment-point"
}

resource "aviatrix_dcf_policy_group" "example" {
    attach_to = data.aviatrix_dcf_attachment_point.example.id // Get the uuid using an aviatrix_dcf_attachment_point datasource
    name = "example-policy-group"

    policy_group_reference {
        priority    = 100
        target_uuid = "10002000-3000-4000-5000-600070008000"
    }
}
```

Note:
An Attachment Point in DCF Policies is like a reserved spot in the policy structure. It lets higher-level admins (like org admins) create a placeholder where lower-level teams (like department admins) can later add their own policy groups. This makes policy management modular and decentralized, so multiple people can contribute without conflicts.
The order of creation doesn’t matter—an existing policy group can link to an attachment point even if that point hasn’t been created yet. This avoids race conditions.
The names of these attachment points must be globally unique to the entire policy tree implementation.

In short the AP( Attachment Point ) can act as a  filler for other teams: As an example "This particular slot is reserved for a specific team (e.g., the Marketing Department) to add their own detailed set of rules later."

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the attachment point which is unique to each attachment point.
* `attachment_point_id` - (Optional) UUID of the attachment point which can be used as an exported output value to get the ID of attachment point when searching by name.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the attachment point which is the same as the attachment_point_id
